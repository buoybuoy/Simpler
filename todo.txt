bugs
	editing transaction from 'activity' page load ajax response (table, right aside, etc.)

	simple changes ID when going from 'hold' to 'journalentry', causing duplicate transactions
		add database column for 'is_hold'
		on database cleaning check if any transactions with 'is_hold' = true has same exact date as other transaction
			update duplicate transaction with hold's budget_category_id, budget_month, and budget_year
			delete transaction with 'is_hold' = true

		or just don't add any transactions where 'is_hold' = true
